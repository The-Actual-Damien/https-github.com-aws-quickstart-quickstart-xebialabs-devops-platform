== Best practices for using {partner-product-name} on AWS
=== Backups
It is recommended to regularly back up the data in the Amazon RDS instance in addition to the contents of the EFS volume. This prevents data loss, if the stack is removed accidentally.

== Security
The security groups and IAM roles are set up to provide minimal access to the software. You can fine-tune them to your needs.
For setting up users and groups in the {partner-company-name} DevOps Platform itself, please refer to the product documentation at https://docs.xebialabs.com.
