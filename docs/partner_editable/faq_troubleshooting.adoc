== FAQ

*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, we recommend that you relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *No*. (This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console, *Options* page.) With this setting, the stack’s state is retained and the instance is left running, so you can troubleshoot the issue. (For Windows, look at the log files in %ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService and C:\cfn\log.)
// If you’re deploying on Linux instances, provide the location for log files on Linux, or omit this sentence.

WARNING: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Please make sure to delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

For additional information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation^] on the AWS website.

*Q.* I encountered a size limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* We recommend that you launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template size limitations. For more information about AWS CloudFormation quotas, see the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS documentation^].

*Q.* Can I use the ‘latest’ tag when specifying a version for the {partner-product-name}?

*A.* The ‘latest’ tag is an anti-pattern in DevOps because it precludes repeatable builds/deployments. This makes it impossible to tell which version was used for the deployment. The {partner-product-name} is not released with a ‘latest’ tag. Rather, {partner-company-name} releases each new version with two tags: the exact (major.minor.patch) version number and a “latest in stream” (major.minor) version number. The “latest in stream” tag will be updated with each subsequent maintenance release of the {partner-product-name}.

*Q.* Can I run the {partner-product-name} on the AWS Free Tier?

*A.* No. The minimum instance sizes needed for the {partner-product-name} are larger than the AWS Free Tier allows.

*Q.* How many AWS resources does the {partner-product-name} use?

*A.* The {partner-product-name} instantiates two to four EC2 hosts in a single ECS cluster for running the {partner-product-name} containers. In addition, one EC2 host is created to provide a bastion host to access your VPC. Finally, you need one Elastic IP address to access the {partner-product-name}.
